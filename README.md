# Gastrointestinal Disorder Detection Using RNN


For my project on gastrointestinal disorder detection, I utilized the Kvasir dataset, applying Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to analyze endoscopic images. The goal was to accurately identify and classify various GI tract conditions. The RNN model effectively captured temporal patterns and dependencies in the image sequences, leading to improved diagnostic accuracy and aiding in early disease detection.# DATASET
### Kvasir Dataset for Classification and Segmentation

The Kvasir dataset, available on Kaggle, contains high-quality images of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract captured during endoscopic procedures. This dataset is ideal for developing and evaluating machine learning models for GI disease detection and segmentation.

#### Key Features:
- **Image Variety**: Images from the esophagus, stomach, and colon.
- **Annotations**: Detailed annotations for classification and segmentation tasks.
- **High Resolution**: High-quality images for precise analysis.
- **Multi-Class Labels**: Multiple classes representing various GI conditions.
- **Segmentation Masks**: Accurate masks for regions of interest.

#### Applications:
- Medical image classification
- Segmentation tasks
- AI research in healthcare

I used this dataset for my project on gastrointestinal disorder detection using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
